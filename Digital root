Write a function that returns the digital root of an integer n.

The digital root of a number n is obtained as follows: Add up the digits n to get a new number. 
Add up the digits of that to get another new number.
Keep doing this until you get a number that has only one digit. That number is the digital root.

For example, if n = 45893 ,
 add up the digits to get 4 + 5 + 8 + 9 + 3 = 29
 add up the digits of 29 to get 2 + 9 = 11
 add up the digits of 11 to get 1 + 1 = 2
 since 2 being single digit, is the digital root.

Input:  Integer 
Output: Integer 

Sample Input: 45893 
Sample Output: 2

Code 

def digital_root(n):
    sum1=0
    if n>0 and n<=9:
        return n
    else:
        while(n>0):
            d=n%10
            sum1=sum1+d
            n=n//10
        sum2=digital_root(sum1)
        return sum2
