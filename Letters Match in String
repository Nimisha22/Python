Write a function that takes two strings and returns how many matches there are between the strings. A match is where the two strings have the same character at the same index. 

Input: string 1, string 2
Output:  Integer 

Sample Input:  "common", "come" 
Sample Output:  3

Code

def matches(s1, s2):
    cnt = 0
    k=min(len(s1), len(s2))
    for i in range(k):
        if s1[i] == s2[i]:
            cnt += 1
    return cnt
