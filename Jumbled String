Write a function that produces a new string by selecting letters in a given string as per the following rule:

The function takes a string and a starting integer START arguments.

In the first step it visits the character at index START. Then it visits the next character: that is at START + 1. 
In the next step it visits two characters after that; that is START + 3, then three characters after that: that is START + 6 and so on. 
If the string ends it goes around to the beginning. It stops when 10 characters have been visited.

Signature: pick10(s: str, n:int) -> str

Additional condition: return string length is 10 characters

Input: String, Int
Output: String

Sample Input: "ABC", 1        
Sample Output: "BCBBCBBCBB"

Code

from math import *

def pick10(s: str, n:int) -> str:
    final = []
    p = ceil(n + 55 // len(s))
    s = s * p
    index = n
    for i in range(0, 10):
        index += i
        final.append(s[index])
    final = "".join(final)
    return fina
